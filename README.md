# Anjou

Anjou brings you, your stuff, some other programmer and their stuff all together on a pair programming machine.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'anjou'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install anjou

## Usage

This thing is still kinda rough, and it lacks a command-line interface (which is a pretty big
deal, considering).  Stay tuned, though.

## Contributing

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request
7. Count your money
